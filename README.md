# Non-SpatialMLProjects
Collection of non-spatially explicit ML projects I completed at USC during my MS.

I have a separate private repo containing the code and models. I am happy to share on a case-by-case basis to preserve academic integrity. Please reach out if you are curious: alexanderreesebrown@gmail.com

### vertebral_column_kNN_classification.ipynb

Using parametric kNN classifiers on biomedical data. Exploring effects of different Ks, polling methods, and distance metrics.

### energy_output_regression.ipynb

Predicting factory energy output from sensor data. EDA, univariate, multivariate, and Knn regression, L1/L2 regularization, non-linear predictors, hypothesis testing.

### biometric_time_series_classification.ipynb

Classification of human movement patterns from wearable biometric sensors. Time domain feature extraction, binary/multiclass logistic regression models, gaussian/multinomial naive bayes, model analysis (roc/auc, confusion matricies, visual separation), case controlled sampling.

### interpetable_classifiers.ipynb

Exploring various classification/prediction methods where interpretability is major concern (i.e. crime prediction, medical diagnoses). Tree based methods (hierarchical decision trees, random forests, L1 penalized gradient boosting tree, pruning), PCR regression, Lasso regression.

### air_brake_classification_with_imbalanced_classes.ipynb

Exploring various methods for treating class imbalance on truck air brake sensor and failure data. Over/under sampling, iterative imputation for mising data, balanced random forest classification, XGBoost Classification.

### frog_call_multiclass_multilabel_classification.ipynb

Exploring multiclass/multilabel classification of frog species based on audio signals. Feature extraction, hamming/exact match loss, gaussian SVM kernels, clustering methods.

### sentiment_analysis_deep_learning.ipynb

Text sentiment analysis (classification) using deep learning (MLPs, CNNs, LSTMs).
